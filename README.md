# lkd-simple-scraper

This is a simple lkd scraper. All you need is:

## name_list.csv

In the main folder, you have to paste the companies names, one company per line.

## chromedriver.exe

In this project I used Selenium webdriver, so, you have to download the correct chromedriver.exe according to your Google Chrome version.
